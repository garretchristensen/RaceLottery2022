# High Lonesome 2022 Lottery
An interactive, transparent, and reproducible design for the 2022 High Lonesome 100 lottery. Code by Garret Christensen, volunteering in exchange for whiskey. Thanks to Caleb for a great race and wanting to do things transparently. If any other RDs are interested in running their lotteries transparently, I'd love to talk!

The lottery is implemented via R Shiny apps [here](https://garretchristensen.shinyapps.io/Lottery2022/).

The code for it is all in this repository that you're looking at.

* Lottery.Rmd implements the lottery
* test2022_noemails.csv and similarly named files are data for testing, and will be replaced with the real data as soon as it becomes available
* 2022HL100FINAL.csv is the real data, from RunSignup and verified by the RD
